# Py-Staff

Py-Staff (Python Stellar Absorption Feature Fitting) is a python code to recover stellar population parameters (such as Stellar Age, Metallicity and the Initial Mass Function) from visible and near-IR spectra of nearby galaxies. It's built to work with the newest version of the single stellar population models of Conroy, Villame, van Dokkum & Lind (described [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018ApJ...854..139C/abstract)) which are available on request from Charlie Conroy's [website](https://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy/sps-models). 

The code has been used in Vaughan et. al 2018b, to measure the stellar population of NGC 1399 using data from MUSE.
